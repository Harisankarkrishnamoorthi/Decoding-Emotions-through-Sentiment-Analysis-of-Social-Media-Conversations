# 💬 Decoding Emotions through Sentiment Analysis of Social Media Conversations

This project explores how to detect and decode human emotions by analyzing sentiment in social media conversations using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques.

## 🧠 Overview

Social media platforms are rich sources of public opinion and emotional expression. This project aims to build a pipeline that extracts, processes, and classifies emotional sentiment from posts and comments on platforms such as Twitter, Reddit, or Facebook.

## 📌 Objectives

- Extract and preprocess social media text data.
- Perform sentiment and emotion classification (e.g., joy, anger, sadness, fear).
- Visualize emotional trends and insights.
- Explore real-time or near-real-time applications of emotion detection.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Tweepy / PRAW (for data collection)
- Pandas, NumPy
- NLTK, SpaCy, TextBlob, VADER
- Scikit-learn, TensorFlow / PyTorch
- Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
